jquery.expand.js
================

A jquery plugin to expand and collapse content

The outstanding and excellent expand.js plugin has originally (version 1.3.8.2) been written by Adriana Palazova (http://www.adipalaz.com) and is dual licensed under the MIT (http://www.adipalaz.com/docs/mit-license.txt) and GPL (http://www.adipalaz.com/docs/gpl-license.txt) licenses.

The current version of the plugin is 1.4 and so far the only feature I've added (because I needed it) are various new configuration settings to allow for customisation of the generated expand/collapse code. This is kind of a friendly fork because I wanted to share the changes (and other upcoming ones) back to whoever wants to make use of them.

Also, version 1.4 fixes an issue the plugin had with newer versions of jQuery (1.9+).

You can find a variety of demos and explanations of how to use the plugin on Adriana's site (http://www.adipalaz.com/experiments/jquery/expand.html). There you will also find options to donate if you like the plugin and work a lot with it.

This and following versions of the libray provided here are as well dual licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses (as provided in this repository).

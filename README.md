jquery.expand.js
================

A jquery plugin to expand and collapse content

The outstanding and excellent expand.js plugin has originally (version 1.3.8.2) been written written by Adriana Palazova (http://www.adipalaz.com) and is dual licensed under the MIT (http://www.adipalaz.com/docs/mit-license.txt) and GPL (http://www.adipalaz.com/docs/gpl-license.txt) licenses.

The current version of the plugin is 1.3.8.3 and so far the only feature I've added (because I needed it) is a new configuration setting to allow for customisation of the generated expand/collapse code. This is kind of a friendly fork because I wanted to share the changes (and other upcoming ones) back to whoever whants to make use of them.

You can find a variety of demos and explanations of how to use the plugin on Adriana's site (http://www.adipalaz.com/experiments/jquery/expand.html). There you will also find options to donate if you like the plugin and work a lot with it.

This and following versions of the libray provided here are as well dual licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses as provided in this repository.
